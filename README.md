# Back-Propagation
This is a single hidden layer neural network that uses back propagation to train the network. It was created by The Coding Train in JavaScript, but my library is a replica in Python. This library does not use numpy as most Python neural networks do. This library was a way of learning how to implement the back propagation algorithm into a neural network.

Here is the first video in the Youtube series I followed along with when creating the library: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ7HLz9VYz0&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aCibgK1PTWWu9by6XFdCfh
